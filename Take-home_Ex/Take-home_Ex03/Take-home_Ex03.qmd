In this take-home exercise, you are required to:

-   Select a weather station and download [historical daily temperature or rainfall data](http://www.weather.gov.sg/climate-historical-daily/) from [Meteorological Service Singapore](http://www.weather.gov.sg/home/) website,

-   Select either daily temperature or rainfall records of a month of the year 1983, 1993, 2003, 2013 and 2023 and create an analytics-driven data visualisation,

-   Apply appropriate interactive techniques to enhance the user experience in data discovery and/or visual story-telling.
