  Me doing VAA->>My son: Because it takes time to do a good job! 
  My son->>Me doing VAA: But, if you don't like it, why do you do it?
  Me doing VAA->>My son: Do you do things that you don't like?
  My son->>Me doing VAA: No!
  My brain->>Me doing VAA: But... but I have no choice... ðŸ¥² 
  Me doing VAA->>My son: Well, sometimes you have to do things you don't like so as to reach what makes you happy.
