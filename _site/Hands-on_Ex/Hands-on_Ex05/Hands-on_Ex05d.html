<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">4.1: Overview</h2>
<p>Parallel coordinates plot is a data visualisation specially designed for visualising and analysing multivariate, numerical data. It is ideal for comparing multiple variables together and seeing the relationships between them. For example, the variables contribute to Happiness Index. Parallel coordinates was invented by <a href="http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~aiisreal/">Alfred Inselberg</a> in the 1970s as a way to visualize high-dimensional data. This data visualisation technique is more often found in academic and scientific communities than in business and consumer data visualizations. As pointed out by <a href="https://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/b-eye/parallel_coordinates.pdf">Stephen Few</a>(2006), ‚ÄúThis certainly isn‚Äôt a chart that you would present to the board of directors or place on your Web site for the general public. In fact, the strength of parallel coordinates isn‚Äôt in their ability to communicate some truth in the data to others, but rather in their ability to bring meaningful multivariate patterns and comparisons to light when used interactively for analysis.‚Äù For example, parallel coordinates plot can be used to characterise clusters detected during customer segmentation.</p>
<p>By the end of this hands-on exercise, you will gain hands-on experience on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>plotting statistic parallel coordinates plots by using <em>ggparcoord()</em> of <strong>GGally</strong> package,</p></li>
<li><p>plotting interactive parallel coordinates plots by using <strong>parcoords</strong> package, and</p></li>
<li><p>plotting interactive parallel coordinates plots by using <strong>parallelPlot</strong> package.</p></li>

<span id="cb11-21"><a href="#cb11-21" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Parallel coordinates plot is a data visualisation specially designed for visualising and analysing multivariate, numerical data. It is ideal for comparing multiple variables together and seeing the relationships between them. For example, the variables contribute to Happiness Index. Parallel coordinates was invented by <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Alfred Inselberg</span><span class="co">](http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~aiisreal/)</span> in the 1970s as a way to visualize high-dimensional data. This data visualisation technique is more often found in academic and scientific communities than in business and consumer data visualizations. As pointed out by <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Stephen Few</span><span class="co">](https://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/b-eye/parallel_coordinates.pdf)</span>(2006), ‚ÄúThis certainly isn‚Äôt a chart that you would present to the board of directors or place on your Web site for the general public. In fact, the strength of parallel coordinates isn‚Äôt in their ability to communicate some truth in the data to others, but rather in their ability to bring meaningful multivariate patterns and comparisons to light when used interactively for analysis.‚Äù For example, parallel coordinates plot can be used to characterise clusters detected during customer segmentation.</span>
