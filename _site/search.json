It was interesting to see different examples of the layers but after awhile it got a little tedious. I did have a lot of time to play around with Quarto and RStudio so that I could quickly familiarise myself.\nI do hope to see more of how we can structure our thinking of data analytics according to a Layered Grammar of Graphics (Am loving this!). I am looking forward to this course!"

Their positions are also clear but I would prefer the ggtitle to be centered, rather than at the side so I added one extra line of code).\nWhile binning on 10 with ggplot2 is the same number of bins as R Graphics, ggplot2 gives us quartiles - Quartiles are useful for the measure of central tendency and spread for highly skewed data, which is the case for MATHS.\nThe background of ggplot2 have grid lines which makes it easier for the eye to follow the values.\n\n\n\nApparently, this is due to the notion of visual variables (that was introduced by Jacques Bertin in 1967) and the associated levels of perception affect the effectiveness of data visualisation.\n\nThe transferable skills from ggplot2 are not the idiosyncrasies of plotting syntax, but a powerful way of thinking about visualisation, as a way of mapping between variables and the visual properties of geometric objects that you can perceive. ~Hadley Wickham\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAm loving this!\n\n\n\nInterestingly, how we visualise this data should reflect how we make sense of the world. The following quote also stood out for me as it reinforces the notion that data visualisation is not isolated from data analysis - “Data analysis without data visualisation is no data analysis” (Cleveland, 1994 in Kam, 2023).\n\nggplot2 is designed to work iteratively. You start with a layer that shows the raw data. Then you add layers of annotations and statistical summaries. This allows you to produce graphics using the same structured thinking that you would use to design an analysis. This reduces the distance between the plot in your head and the one on the page. This is especially helpful for students who have not yet developed the structured approach to analysis used by experts. ~Hadley Wickham (bold my own)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 A Layered Grammar of Graphics\n\n\n\nReference: Hadley Wickham (2010) “A layered grammar of graphics.” Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 3–28.\n\n\n\nData: The dataset being plotted.\nAesthetics take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.\nFacets split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics, statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate systems define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.\nThemes modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background.\n\n\n\n2.3 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: data\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nA blank canvas appears.\nggplot() initializes a ggplot object.\nThe data argument defines the dataset to be used for plotting.\nIf the dataset is not already a data.frame, it will be converted to one by fortify().\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: Aesthetic mappings\nAesthetic mappings take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics such as position, colour, size, shape, or transparency (also part of Bertin’s and other researchers’ set of “retinal” variables). Each visual characteristic can thus encode an aspect of the data and be used to convey information.\nAll aesthetics of a plot are specified in the aes() function call (each geom layer can have its own aes specification).\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nggplot includes the x-axis and the axis’s label.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: geom\nGeometric objects are the actual marks we put on a plot. Examples include:\n\ngeom_point for drawing individual points (e.g., a scatter plot)\ngeom_line for drawing lines (e.g., for a line charts)\ngeom_smooth for drawing smoothed lines (e.g., for simple trends or approximations)\ngeom_bar for drawing bars (e.g., for bar charts)\ngeom_histogram for drawing binned values (e.g. a histogram)\ngeom_polygon for drawing arbitrary shapes\ngeom_map for drawing polygons in the shape of a map! (You can access the data to use for these maps by using the map_data() function).\n\n\n\nA plot must have at least one geom; there is no upper limit. You can add a geom to a plot using the + operator.\nFor complete list, please refer to here.\n\n\n2.5.1 Geometric Objects: geom_bar\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Geometric Objects: geom_dotplot\nIn a dot plot, the width of a dot corresponds to the bin width (or maximum width, depending on the binning algorithm), and dots are stacked, with each dot representing one observation.\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.5)\n\n\nBin width defaults to 1/30 of the range of the data. Pick better value with\n`binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe y scale is not very useful, in fact it is very misleading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n?Question? 1\n\n\n\nI wonder why the y scale is suddenly in decimal place (0.00, 0.25 etc) when it was previously in count.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below performs the following two steps:\n\nscale_y_continuous() is used to turn off the y-axis, and\nbinwidth argument is used to change the binwidth to 2.5.\n\n\n\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(binwidth=2.5,         \n               dotsize = 0.5) +      \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,           \n                     breaks = NULL) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n?Question? 2\n\n\n\n\nI wonder why the binwidth is changed to 2.5. It looks the same as the previous binning.\n\n\n\n\nWith binwidth = 2\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(binwidth=2,         \n               dotsize = 0.5) +      \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,           \n                     breaks = NULL) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith binwidth = 3.5\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(binwidth=3.5,         \n               dotsize = 0.5) +      \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,           \n                     breaks = NULL) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nbinwidth “controls the width of each bin along the X-axis” (R Coder, 2024). While it might be similar between binwidth = 2.5 and 3, it is more proportionate than when binwidth =2 and 3.5 and therefore pleasing to the eye. Thus, changing to 2.5 is just to address the error code.\n\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Geometric Objects: geom_histogram()\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram() \n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

It visualises five summary statistics (the median, two hinges and two whiskers), and all “outlying” points individually.\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS,       \n           x= GENDER)) +    \n  geom_boxplot()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotches are used in box plots to help visually assess whether the medians of distributions differ. If the notches do not overlap, this is evidence that the medians are different.\nThe code chunk below plots the distribution of Maths scores by gender in notched plot instead of boxplot.\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.8 Geometric Objects: geom_violin\ngeom_violin is designed for creating violin plot. Violin plots are a way of comparing multiple data distributions. With ordinary density curves, it is difficult to compare more than just a few distributions because the lines visually interfere with each other. With a violin plot, it’s easier to compare several distributions since they’re placed side by side.\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_violin() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.9 Geometric Objects: geom_point()\ngeom_point() is especially useful for creating scatterplot.\nThe code chunk below plots a scatterplot showing the Maths and English grades of pupils by using geom_point().\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.10 geom objects can be combined\nThe code chunk below plots the data points on the boxplots by using both geom_boxplot() and geom_point().\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +                    \n  geom_point(position=\"jitter\", \n             size = 0.5) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: stat\nThe Statistics functions statistically transform data, usually as some form of summary.

They are an alternative to aesthetics for displaying additional discrete variables. ggplot2 supports two types of factes, namely: facet_grid() and facet_wrap.\n\n2.7.1 Working with facet_wrap()\nfacet_wrap wraps a 1d sequence of panels into 2d. This is generally a better use of screen space than facet_grid because most displays are roughly rectangular.\nThe code chunk below plots a trellis plot using facet-wrap().\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20) +\n    facet_wrap(~ CLASS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7.2 facet_grid()function\nfacet_grid() forms a matrix of panels defined by row and column facetting variables. It is most useful when you have two discrete variables, and all combinations of the variables exist in the data.\nThe code chunk below plots a trellis plot using facet_grid().\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20) +\n    facet_wrap(~ CLASS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.8 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: Coordinates\nThe Coordinates functions map the position of objects onto the plane of the plot. There are a number of different possible coordinate systems to use, they are:\n-   [`coord_cartesian()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_cartesian.html): the default cartesian coordinate systems, where you specify x and y values (e.g. allows you to zoom in or out). \n-   [`coord_flip()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_flip.html): a cartesian system with the x and y flipped. \n-   [`coord_fixed()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_fixed.html): a cartesian system with a \"fixed\" aspect ratio (e.g. 1.78 for a \"widescreen\" plot). \n-   [`coord_quickmap()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_map.html): a coordinate system that approximates a good aspect ratio for maps.\n\n2.8.1 Working with Coordinate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBy the default, the bar chart of ggplot2 is in vertical form.\n\n\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below flips the horizontal bar chart into vertical bar chart by using coord_flip().\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.8.2 Changing the y- and x-axis range\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot below is slightly misleading because the y-axis and x-axis range are not equal.\n\n\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, size=0.5)\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below fixed both the y-axis and x-axis range from 0-100.\n\n\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.9 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: themes\nThemes control elements of the graph not related to the data. For example:\n\nbackground colour\nsize of fonts\ngridlines\ncolour of labels\n\nBuilt-in themes include: - theme_gray() (default) - theme_bw() - theme_classic()\nA list of theme can be found at this link. Each theme element can be conceived of as either a line (e.g. x-axis), a rectangle (e.g. graph background), or text (e.g. axis title).\n\n2.9.1 Working with theme\nThe code chunk below plot a horizontal bar chart using theme_gray().\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_gray()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA horizontal bar chart plotted using theme_classic().\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA horizontal bar chart plotted using theme_minimal().\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal()"

In this section, I am going to shared with you an ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily.

    "text": "1.2 The Literature Review\n\nEquity in education means that personal or social circumstances such as gender, socio-economic status, migrant background, age, special needs, or place of residence, do not hinder the achievement of one’s educational potential (fairness) ~OECD Education GPS (2023)\n\nIn Singapore, due to our meritocratic system, education and schools are seen as the great equaliser (although talk about equality of opportunities has shifted towards equity of opportunities) to ensure that every child has the same opportunity to academically excel. At the same time, demographic indicators such as Gender and SES also affect academic performance.\n\n1.2.1 Schools and academic performance1.2.2 SES and academic performance1.2.3 Gender and academic performance\n\n\nMinister for Education Chan Chun Sing, in a 2023 MOE speech, stated that:\n\nOECD’s PISA study found that our students from less advantaged backgrounds not only outperformed their international counterparts of similar socio-economic backgrounds, but they did better than the OECD average in all core domains.\n\nThese students typically have less access to private tuition, and have still managed to do well by international standards.\nThis goes to show that our students are industrious, and our education system is doing something right.\nInstead of attributing our students’ achievements to the private tuition industry, I think we should give credit to our students, schools, and teachers where credit is due.\n\n\nPISA (2022) reported that:\n\nIn Singapore, compared to attending a public school, the difference in mathematics performance associated with attendance at private schools is among the smallest of the OECD and partner countries/economies, after accounting for students’ and schools’ socio-economic profile.\n\nThis suggests that schools play an equalising role in academic performance, especially for Math (according to PISA). However, there is still an unofficial differentiation of schools into Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3, despite MOE removing school rankings. As argued by the article “Is Every School a Good School? Intergenerational Mobility in Singapore, Explained”(The Kopi, 2022), “differences in funding, programmes and networks means that some schools might provide more opportunities for [their own] students than others”.\n\n\nThe imbalance in resources due to the difference in socioeconomic status affects a child’s education journey as according to the article “Commentary: How can Singapore lessen the impact of SES on educational achievements?” (ChannelNewsAsia, 29 Sept 2022),”parents with the financial means can provide resources such as tuition to enhance their children’s learning, and better provide them with a head-start in life.”\nThis was supported by PISA (2022):\n\nSingapore has one of the highest differences in mathematics performance between students in the top quarter and students in the bottom quarter of the economic, social and cultural status index (ESCS).\n\nThe difference in mathematics performance associated with a one-unit increase in the PISA index of economic, social and cultural status (ESCS) is one of the largest among PISA-participating countries and economies.\nThe difference in science performance associated with a one-unit increase in the PISA index of economic, social and cultural status (ESCS) is one of the largest among PISA-participating countries and economies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand To Learn More About The Effect of SES on academic performance\n\n\n\n\n\n“Parents with the financial means can provide resources such as tuition to enhance their children’s learning, and better provide them with a head-start in life. Conversely, parents from the lower-income brackets tend to lack the resources to augment their children’s learning.\nWithout adequate guidance at home, children from less financially stable families are often ill-prepared for learning. As a result, pupils from more humble backgrounds are identified as weaker students as early as Primary 1.\nAdditionally, these students often do not have role models who can advise them on the pathways to educational success. This often affects their ability to make sound decisions, due to a lack of awareness of the implications that their choices may have on their future.\nThese early academic gaps widen when students from higher-income families continue to outperform and move on to schools that have more access to resources.\nFor instance, independent schools that cater to higher-achieving students will have resources that expose them to enrichment programmes and out-of-classroom learning activities.\nWhen students from humbler families lag their higher SES classmates in academic performance, this can have larger implications on social mobility as well, as national exams determine the type of education these children will go on to receive, the future friends and connections they make, and their eventual jobs.”\n\n\n\n\n\nGender inequality seems to have changed in favour of girls over time - Statistics Singapore (2022) reported that “with more rapid improvement in educational attainment among females, the difference in mean years of schooling” has narrowed, with it becoming smaller for the younger age groups.\n\n\n\nTaken from Statistics Singapore (2022)\n\n\nPISA (2022) also found that:\n\nBoys outperformed girls in mathematics by 12 score points; girls outperformed boys in reading by 20 score points in Singapore.\n\nThe difference between girls and boys in science performance is one of the largest among PISA-participating countries and economies in favour of girls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand To Learn More About The Effect of Gender on academic performance\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was reported in a 2017 article “Girls lead in primary school but boys catch up: MOE study“ (The Straits Times, 22 Jan 2017:\n“Girls tend to outdo boys academically at a younger age although this gap closes as they enter their late teens and early 20s.\nStatistics from the Ministry of Education (MOE) showed that in the last 10 years, girls performed “slightly better” than boys in the Primary School Leaving Examination. Girls were around 2 to 3 percentage points over-represented in the top quintile, and about 3 to 4 percentage points under-represented in the bottom quintile.\nAt the O levels, girls were around 1 to 2 percentage points over-represented in the top quintile and about 1 to 2 percentage points under-represented in the bottom quintile.\nBut there was hardly any distinction in qualification to the tertiary level. The numbers of males and females pursuing degrees in local universities have been comparable over the past three years, said the ministry.\nFor instance, out of a total of 18,126 undergraduates in the 2015 intake for the six publicly-funded universities, 9,192 were female.”"

However, PISA analysts indicate that using one or five plausible values in a large sample does not make a substantial difference” (bold my own).\nThis section visually investigates if there is significant difference between the distribution of plausible values.\n\nStep 1: Filtering PVsStep 2: Aggregating new variables\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below filters out PV1MATH and the other 9 PVs, PV1READ and the other 9 PVs, PV1SCIE and the other 9 PVs into a new data frame.\n\n\n\ncode block\npv_data &lt;- stu_qqq_SG[, c(\"PV1MATH\", \"PV2MATH\", \"PV3MATH\", \"PV4MATH\", \"PV5MATH\", \"PV6MATH\", \"PV7MATH\", \"PV8MATH\", \"PV9MATH\", \"PV10MATH\", \"PV1READ\", \"PV2READ\", \"PV3READ\", \"PV4READ\", \"PV5READ\", \"PV6READ\", \"PV7READ\", \"PV8READ\", \"PV9READ\", \"PV10READ\", \"PV1SCIE\", \"PV2SCIE\", \"PV3SCIE\", \"PV4SCIE\", \"PV5SCIE\", \"PV6SCIE\", \"PV7SCIE\", \"PV8SCIE\", \"PV9SCIE\", \"PV10SCIE\")]\n\nglimpse(pv_data)\n\n\nRows: 6,606\nColumns: 30\n$ PV1MATH  &lt;dbl&gt;

Science Scores with Schools, SES and Gender\n\nVisual Considerations\n\nThe aim of these visualisations was to show the relation between the different types of scores, and schools, SES and Gender.\nTrends in each plot were emphasized by:\n\nusing geom_vline to visualise the mean,\nusing annotate to identify and label the mean.\n\nPlots were coded separately and put side-by-side to see the relationships between scores, schools, SES and gender by Math, Reading and Science using patchwork.\nInsets of distributions of variables (schools, SES and gender) were attempted but due to patchwork, the resulting visualisations were too cluttered and thus, had its own section 2.3.1 Visualising Math, Reading, Science, Schools, SES and Gender.\nWell-worded titles with a story were crafted.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below visualises the distribution of Math scores using histogram, ridgeline plot, scatterplot and raincloud plot.\n\n\n\n2.3.2.1 Visualising Math with Schools, SES and

separately and put side-by-side to see the relationships between scores, schools, SES and gender by Math, Reading and Science using patchwork.\nInsets of distributions of variables (schools, SES and

and Schools, SES and Gender\n\nThere is a wide variation in the distribution of Math scores between the top 5 and bottom 5 schools. The top 5 schools are ahead of the mean and the bottom 5 schools are below. This suggests that certain schools are associated with higher Math scores.\nThere appears to be an association between Math scores and SES with lower SES associated with lower Math Scores.\n\nThe axes of the scatterplot are slightly weird and the choice of scatterplot might not be the most ideal.\n\nMale students tend to score higher on average than female students, with male students scoring higher than the mean score on average.\n\nReading and Schools, SES and Gender\n\nThe distribution of Reading scores between the top 5 and bottom 5 schools is closer to the mean line. The top 5 schools are still ahead of the mean and the bottom 5 schools are below but the distribution of the bottom 5 schools appear to be more varied This suggests that certain schools are associated with higher Reading scores.\nThere appears to be an association between Reading scores and SES with lower SES associated with lower Reading Scores.\n\nThe axes of the scatterplot are slightly weird and the choice of scatterplot might not be the most ideal.\n\nInversely, female students tend to score higher on average than male students, with female students scoring higher than the mean score on average.\n\nScience and Schools, SES and Gender\n\nThe top 5 schools are ahead of the mean and the bottom 5 schools are below the mean but closer to it. This suggests that certain schools are associated with higher Science scores.\nThere appears to be an association between Science scores and SES with lower SES associated with lower Science Scores.\n\nThe axes of the scatterplot are slightly weird and the choice of scatterplot might not be the most ideal.\n\nMale students tend to score higher on average than female students, although the gap is small.\n\nThis visualisation contradicts the PISA finding that females scored higher than males (see [1.2.3 Gender and academic performance]). This requires more research into the data."

More research must be carried out to test if these hypotheses are statistically significant. Thus, even though every school is a “good” school, the literature review has argued that there are visible and hidden factors that influence a student’s academic performance. These exploratory data visualisations suggest that there is grounds for more research."

    "text": "4.2 Data Limitations\n\nSampling bias: The sample data appears to be skewed to the right for SES (gender seems arguably proportionate) and thus, we cannot accurately say that the data is representative of the entire Singapore 15 years old students population. Although not covered in this exercise and in PISA, race is a significant contributor to academic performance and the lack of information on it does not reveal if the sample is biased towards one racial group. Thus, we again cannot say if the sample data reflects the broader population.\nIncomplete measurements: Even though we can see that some schools are associated with higher test scores, we are not sure what are the reasons for it. Due to the limitation of this exercise, only one variable was selected even though other variables of interest might explain why. Moreover, data from school/teachers questionnaires were not considered in this exercise, limiting the conclusions we can draw from it.\n\nOther areas of interest is the relationship between family and SES. The interplay of factors is interesting to study.\n\nNo testing done: Due to the limitation of this exercise, no hypothesis testing was carried out. While the data visualisations and data exploration have highlighted some associations, it is unclear if these factors directly impact academic scores. More research must be done to test these hypotheses."

    "text": "2: Hands-on Exercise\n\n2.1 Interactive Data Visualisation - ggiraph methods\n\nWhat did Prof Kam say?\nggiraph  is an html widget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\nIf it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n\n\n2.1.2 Tooltip\n\nTooltip effect with tooltip aestheticDisplaying multiple information on tooltipDisplaying multiple information on tooltipCustomising Tooltip styleDisplaying statistics on tooltip\n\n\n\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Then, girafe() will be used to generate an svg object to be displayed on an html page.\n\n\n\ncode block\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below. The first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip. At the same time, it populates text in ID and CLASS fields into the newly created field. Next, this newly created field is used as tooltip field as shown in the code of line 7.\n\n\n\ncode block\nexam_data$tooltip &lt;- c(paste0(     \n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,         \n  \"\\n Class = \", exam_data$CLASS)) \n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), \n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below. The first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip. At the same time, it populates text in ID and CLASS fields into the newly created field. Next, this newly created field is used as tooltip field as shown in the code of line 7.\n\n\n\ncode block\nexam_data$tooltip &lt;- c(paste0(     \n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,         \n  \"\\n Class = \", exam_data$CLASS)) \n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), \n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses opts_tooltip() of ggiraph to customize tooltip rendering by add css declarations.

Different from other plotly platform, plot.R is free and open source.\nThere are two ways to create interactive graph by using plotly, they are:\n\nby using plot_ly(),\nand by using ggplotly()\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Creating an interactive scatter plot: plot_ly() method\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncode block\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n             x = ~MATHS, \n             y = ~ENGLISH)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Working with visual variable: plot_ly() method\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, color argument is mapped to a qualitative visual variable (i.e. RACE).\n\n\n\ncode block\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n        x = ~ENGLISH, \n        y = ~MATHS, \n        color = ~RACE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Coordinated Multiple Views with plotly\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe creation of a coordinated linked plot by using plotly involves three steps:\n\nhighlight_key() of plotly package is used as shared data.\ntwo scatterplots will be created by using ggplot2 functions.\nlastly, subplot() of plotly package is used to place them next to each other side-by-side.\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk:\n\nhighlight_key() simply creates an object of class crosstalk::SharedData.\nVisit this link to learn more about crosstalk,\n\n\n\n\ncode block\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data)\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = SCIENCE)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nsubplot(ggplotly(p1),\n        ggplotly(p2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Interactive Data Visualisation - crosstalk methods!\n\nWhat did Prof Kam say?\nCrosstalk is an add-on to the htmlwidgets package. It extends htmlwidgets with a set of classes, functions, and conventions for implementing cross-widget interactions (currently, linked brushing and filtering).\n\n\n2.3.1 Interactive Data Table: DT package\n\nA wrapper of the JavaScript Library DataTables\nData objects in R can be rendered as HTML tables using the JavaScript library ‘DataTables’ (typically via R Markdown or Shiny).\n\n\n\ncode block\nDT::datatable(exam_data, class= \"compact\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Linked brushing: crosstalk method\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk:\n\nhighlight() is a function of plotly package. It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document. Warning: This will bring in all of Bootstrap!.\n\n\n\n\ncode block\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data) \np &lt;- ggplot(d, \n            aes(ENGLISH, \n                MATHS)) + \n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\ngg &lt;- highlight(ggplotly(p),        \n                \"plotly_selected\")  \n\ncrosstalk::bscols(gg,               \n                  DT::datatable(d), \n                  widths = 5)"

It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\nIf it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides.

Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Then, girafe() will be used to generate an svg object to be displayed on an html page.\n\n\n\ncode block\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below. The first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip. At the same time, it populates text in ID and CLASS fields into the newly created field. Next, this newly created field is used as tooltip field as shown in the code of line 7.\n\n\n\ncode block\nexam_data$tooltip &lt;- c(paste0(     \n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,         \n  \"\\n Class = \", exam_data$CLASS)) \n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), \n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below.

    "text": "1.2 Terminology\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\nBefore you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts."

    "text": "2.1 Distribution Across Three Subjects - Mathematics, Reading and Science\n\n\nThe author stated:\nWe will now do the plot for each respective subject. We will be doing a histogram to show the distribution across three subjects. The figure in the tabset below displays a composite of three histograms, seamlessly created using patchwork. This is specifically designed for merging separate ggplot2 graphs into a unified figure. The red dotted line indicates the mean.\nHe later went on to conclude:\nThe histogram presented above offers a visual representation of the distribution of scores across three academic subjects: MATHEMATICS, READING and SCIENCE. The distribution pattern observed for each subject strongly aligns with the characteristics of a normal distribution (bold my own).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA normal distribution is characterised by a symmetrical bell-shaped curve, with the majority of data points clustering around the mean and gradually tapering off towards the extremes. In the context of academic performance, this implies that a significant proportion of students scored close to the average, while fewer students achieved scores either significantly above or below the mean.\n\n2.1.1 Own Thoughts\nOne key issue I want to highlight is the author’s conclusion that the distributions of all three scores are normal. My own personal conclusion were the distributions were left-skewed.\n\nVisual Challenges\n\nThe visualisations did not clearly represent if the distributions were normal or left-skewed.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Critique: Clarity and Aesthetics\nThis uncertainty could be due to how the data was visualised. By using the principles from A Layered Grammar of Graphics,\n\n\n Level 7: Theme (Colour | Space)\n\nAesthetics\n\nThe blue and red, while to provide contrast, does not blend well with the other colours.\nGrid lines are soft and not distracting.\n\nClarity\n\nThe patchwork neatly puts all the plots in one diagram but the dimensions are not equally spaced for each plot (it seems that Science scores are given more weightage than the rest).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 7: Theme (Text)\n\nAesthetics\n\nThere is too much cluttered text: the titles and axes labels are not well placed.\ncount is not placed vertically: may not be necessary\n\nClarity\n\nThere is no overall main title or lead-in to provide a context .e.g. the purpose and the story of the data visualisation.\nThe titles are repeated e.g. Math scores and Mathematics.\nThe axes are not well-labelled e.g. Mathematics as the x-axis.\nThere is no data source caption included.\n\n\n\n\nLevel 6: Coordinates | Level 5: Statistics | Level 3: Geometries | Level 2: Aesthetics\n\nClarity\n\nThe max labelled counts on the x-axis for the three plots are not consistent - 800 for Mathematics vs 750 for Reading and Science.\nThe units of the y-axis for the three plots are not consistent - Math is 400, 600, 800 vs 200, 400, 600 and 800 for Reading and Science; and Science’s x-axis starts at 200 while the rest appears to start at 0.\nThe reference line (the mean) was very important for readability but still failed to fully convey if it was a normal or left-skewed distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Sketch\nThese are my proposed main changes:\n\n\n A well-crafted title and subtitle to provide context.\n Add a median line together with the mean to clearly portray skewness.\n Add a probability density plot to clearly visualise the distribution.\n Standardise the axes to improve comparability and interpretability.\n Put the three plots side-by-side to improve readability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Makeover\nThe code chunk below prepares the individual histogram plots for each subject.\n\nMathematicsReadingScience\n\n\n\n\ncode block\nmath &lt;- ggplot(data = cleaned_data, aes(x = MATH)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), bins = 20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color = \"grey25\", \n                 fill = \"grey90\",\n                 linewidth = 0.3) +\n  geom_density(linewidth = 0.2) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1000), ylim = c(0, 0.0045))  +\n  geom_vline(data = cleaned_data %&gt;%\n               summarize(mean_score = mean(MATH), median_score = median(MATH)),\n             aes(xintercept = median_score), color = \"#008FD5\", linetype = \"dashed\") +  \n  geom_text(data = cleaned_data %&gt;%\n               summarize(mean_score = mean(MATH), median_score = median(MATH)),\n             aes(x = median_score -

    "section": "2.2 Reading vs Mathematics",
    "text": "2.2 Reading vs Mathematics\n\n\nThe author stated:\nThe scatterplot… illustrates a positive correlation between reading and mathematics values. As the reading values increase, so do the corresponding mathematics values. This relationship is further emphasised by the upward trend observed in the best fit line. The consistent increase in one variable is mirrored by a proportional increase in the other. In light of these findings, it can be confidently asserted that a positive connection exists, suggesting that engaging in reading contributes to enhanced performance in mathematics among students (bold my own).\n\n2.2.1 Own Thoughts\n\nThe author’s intention of this data visualisation is a little confusing to me - why does the author only focus on one data visualisation with X = Reading and Y = Mathematics?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBearing in mind that the plot intends to visualise the relationship between two continuous variables, I also automatically thought of the scatterplot. However, while it does visualise the relationship, the data visualisation does not seem intuitive, despite the presence of the linear model line.\n\n\nVisual Challenges\n\nHow can we visually tease out the relationship of reading on the other subjects and vice versa?\nThe visualisation is messy due to overplotting - is there a better way to visualise the relationship between two continuous variables?\nHow can we improve the identification of correlation in a scatterplot?\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Critique: Clarity and Aesthetics\nBy using the principles from A Layered Grammar of Graphics,\n\n\n Level 7: Theme (Colour | Space)\n\nAesthetics\n\nThe choice of black and blue provided a nice contrast.\nGrid lines are soft and not distracting.\n\nClarity\n\nIt was confusing to use only one data visualisation on two subjects to tease out the relationship between subjects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 7: Theme (Text)\n\nAesthetics\n\nAxes are well-labelled so we can tease out any causal relationship between Reading and Mathematics.\n\nClarity\n\nThere is no overall main title or lead-in to provide a context .e.g. the purpose and the story of the data visualisation.\nThere is no data source caption included.\n\n\n\n\nLevel 6: Coordinates | Level 5: Statistics | Level 3: Geometries | Level 2: Aesthetics\n\nAesthetics\n\nOverplotting - the mass of points from each student makes the chart messy and confusing (especially the dark mass in the centre of the reference line).\n\nClarity\n\nThe scales on the x-axis and y-axis are consistent - 800 for Mathematics and Reading scores.\nClearly visualised relationship between Reading and Mathematics scores with the use of a straight reference line - linear model.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Sketch\nThese are my proposed main changes:\n\n\n A well-crafted title and subtitle to provide context.\n Explore four different ways (refer to section below) to address overplotting in the scatterplot.\n Add regression line coefficients to the lm reference line.\n Create 2 more different data visualisations together to check which subjects had relationships with each other e.g. Reading vs Science.\n Put the plots side-by-side to improve comparability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproving overplotting in scatterplots\nAccording to A Complete Guide to Scatter Plots,\n\nOverplotting is the case where data points overlap to a degree where we have difficulty seeing relationships between points and variables. It can be difficult to tell how densely-packed data points are when many of them are in a small area.\nThere are a few common ways to alleviate this issue. One alternative is to sample only a subset of data points: a random selection of points should still give the general idea of the patterns in the full data. We can also change the form of the dots, adding transparency to allow for overlaps to be visible, or reducing point size so that fewer overlaps occur. As a third option, we might even choose a different chart type like the heatmap, where color indicates the number of points in each bin. Heatmaps in this use case are also known as 2-d histograms.\n\n\n\n\nTaken from [A Complete Guide to Scatter Plots](https://chartio.com/learn/charts/what-is-a-scatter-plot/)\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows four different recommended ways to address overplotting.\n\n\nPlot 1 with sampled data (sample = 400)\n\n\ncode block\n# Set the seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Randomly select a sample of about 500 students\nsampled_data &lt;- cleaned_data %&gt;% sample_n(400)\n\n# Create the scatterplot with the sampled data\nsamplescatter &lt;- ggplot(sampled_data, aes(x = READ, y = MATH)) +  \n  geom_point() +\n  stat_poly_eq(use_label(c(\"eq\", \"R2\"))) +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, linewidth = 0.2, color = \"#008FD5\", alpha = 0.3) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1000), ylim = c(0, 1000)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1000, by = 200),  \n                      minor_breaks = seq(0, 1000, by = 100))\nsamplescatter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot 2 with transparency (alpha = 0.03)\n\n\ncode block\ntransscatter &lt;- ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x=READ, y=MATH) ) +  \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.03) +\n  stat_poly_eq(use_label(c(\"eq\", \"R2\"))) +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, linewidth = 0.2, color = \"#008FD5\", alpha = 0.3)  +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1000), ylim = c(0, 1000))  +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1000, by = 200),  \n                     minor_breaks = seq(0, 1000, by = 100))\n\ntransscatter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot 3 with hexagon binning (bins = 25)\n\n\ncode block\nhexscatter &lt;- ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x=READ, y=MATH) ) +\n  geom_hex(bins = 25, color = \"white\", alpha = 0.6) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low=\"#008FD5\",high=\"black\")+\n  stat_poly_eq(use_label(c(\"eq\", \"R2\"))) +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, linewidth = 0.2, color = \"black\", alpha = 0.4)  +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1000), ylim = c(0, 1000))  +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1000, by = 200),  \n                     minor_breaks = seq(0, 1000, by = 100))\n\nhexscatter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot 4 with 2D Histogram (bins = 25)\n\n\ncode block\ntwodscatter &lt;- ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x=READ, y=MATH) ) +\n  geom_bin2d(bins = 25, color = \"white\",alpha = 0.6) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low=\"#008FD5\",high=\"black\")+\n  stat_poly_eq(use_label(c(\"eq\", \"R2\"))) +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, linewidth = 0.2, color = \"black\", alpha = 0.4)  +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1000), ylim = c(0, 1000))  +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1000, by = 200),  \n                     minor_breaks = seq(0, 1000, by = 100))\n \ntwodscatter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, Plot 2 seemed the most aesthetically pleasing -

    "text": "2.3 “Reading” as our main focus\nAs mentioned in the previous section, the author is focusing on Reading scores as\n\n[W]e assert that prioritising reading over mathematics is essential for enhanced performance in science learning.\nHenceforth, our focus will be exclusively on reading, considering it as the primary driver for improved achievement in other subjects, including Mathematics and Science.\n\nThe author took this perspective because:\n\nWith reference to this research paper titled ‘Reading matters more than mathematics in science learning: an analysis of the relationship between student achievement in reading, mathematics, and science’ by Yuanze Zhu, the results revealed that proficiency in reading and mathematics strongly correlated with science achievement, with reading exerting a more substantial influence than mathematics.\n\nThe author built three different plots to uncover the relationship between Gender, Socioeconomic status (SES) and Schools; and Reading scores.\n\nGenderSocioeconomic statusSchools\n\n\nA boxplot was used to visualise the differences in reading scores between females and males.\n\n\n\nA scatterplot was used to derive any relationship between Reading scores and one’s socioeconomic status (SES).\n\n\n\nA boxplot was used to visualise the differences in reading scores amongst the top 5 heavily represented schools (those who had the most students participating) in PISA.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.1 Own Thoughts\n\nI find it confusing to have three separate plots - I think we can group all plots together as the common variable is Reading scores.\nI think the choice of using the top 5 heavily represented schools is not meaningful. Using the label “top 5” is more traditionally associated with performance, rather than size of representation.\n\n\nVisual Challenges\n\nHow can we visually tease out the relationship of the three independent variables on reading scores?\nBoxplots limit our understanding on the shape of distribution, modality and skewness. How can we improve the readability of boxplots?\nHow can we improve SchoolIDs as a meaningful label and visually represent them?\n\n\nAs scatterplots have been critiqued and explored in the previous section of [2.2 Reading vs Mathematics], I will makeover the Reading scores vs ESCS in the same way, while flipping the X- and Y- axis.\n\n\n2.3.2 Critique: Clarity and Aesthetics\nIn this section, I will be critiquing the use of boxplots to visually represent the relationships between Gender and Schools; and Reading scores. By using the principles from A Layered Grammar of Graphics,\n\n\n Level 7: Theme (Colour | Space)\n\nAesthetics\n\nThe choice of black and grey was in line with previous data visualisations, providing consistency.\nThe choice of a red dot (mean) on black provided contrast, but the colours were jarring and not in line with a theme.\nGrid lines are soft and not distracting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClarity\n\nIt was confusing to separate the plots - a story about effects on Reading scores would be better visualised if the plots were together.\n\n\n\nLevel 7: Theme (Text)\n\nAesthetics\n\nAxes are well-labelled so we can immediately see what relationship (X- and Y- variables) the plot is visualising.\n\nClarity\n\nThere is no overall main title or lead-in to provide a context .e.g. the purpose and the story of the data visualisation.\nThere is no data source caption included.\nCNTSCHID as a label is not meaningful.\n\n\n\n\nand  Level 6: Coordinates | Level 5: Statistics | Level 3: Geometries | Level 2: Aesthetics\n\nAesthetics\n\nWhile boxplots give an excellent summary of the statistics, it looks very plain; especially since Males and Females have the same colour or all the schools presented have the same colour.\n\nClarity\n\nBoxplots are good to compare between multiple groups e.g. between Males and Females and between schools.\nThe scales on the x-axis and y-axis are consistent - 800 for Reading scores, but may be too limited at 800 and result in outliers been cut off.\nClearly visualised some skewness with the use of the mean (red dot) and the outliers but hard to compare with other members of the group.\nThe order of groups is also confusing - in the Schools boxplot, there is no inherent order and thus difficult to compare between schools.\nBoxplots do not allow us to observe the detailed shape of distribution of each groups - it was hard to see if the distribution was truly skewed.\nThe boxplots cannot be intuitively interpreted as they are not annotated with the sample population size, mean and median values.\nSchoolIDs and their label CNTSCHID poorly represents the top 5 heavily represented schools in the sample. It does not allow for easy interpretability.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Sketch\nThese are my proposed main changes:\n\n\n A well-crafted title and subtitle to provide context.\n Explore different ways (refer to section below) to improve the simplicity of the boxplot.\n Add text annotations such as the sample size to the boxplots.\n Recreate CNTSCHID by using top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools in Reading scores.\n Makeover the scatterplot of ESCS vs Reading scores using the above section’s scatterplot design.\n Put the plots side-by-side to improve interpretability and readability for Reading scores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproving the visualisation of distribution in a boxplot\nAccording to A Complete Guide to Scatter Plots, The Box Plot: A Simple but Informative Visualizationand 9  Visualising Distribution, there are four ways to improve the simplicity of the boxplot by using:t\n\nNotches in boxplots\n\n\nNotches are used to show the most likely values expected for the median when the data represents a sample. When a comparison is made between groups, you can tell if the difference between medians are statistically significant based on if their ranges overlap. If any of the notch areas overlap, then we can’t say that the medians are statistically different; if they do not have overlap, then we can have good confidence that the true medians differ. A Complete Guide to Scatter Plots\n\n\nViolin plots\n\n\nIn a violin plot, each group’s distribution is indicated by a density curve. In a density curve, each data point does not fall into a single bin like in a histogram, but instead contributes a small volume of area to the total distribution. Violin plots are a compact way of comparing distributions between groups. Often, additional markings are added to the violin plot to also provide the standard box plot information, but this can make the resulting plot noisier to read. A Complete Guide to Scatter Plots\n\n\nRidgeline plots\n\n\nRidgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap. 9  Visualising Distribution\n\n\nRaincloud plots\n\n\nRaincloud Plot is a data visualisation techniques that produces a half-density to a distribution plot. It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does! 9  Visualising Distribution\n\n\nFor Gender\nThe code chunk below shows four different recommended ways to improve the boxplot’s simplicity for two categories e.g. males and females.\n\n\nPlot 1 with Notched Boxplots\n\n\ncode block\ngender_counts &lt;- cleaned_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(GENDER) %&gt;%\n  summarise(count = n())\n\nggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = READ, y = GENDER, color = GENDER)) +  \n  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"#c73824\", \"#0477bf\")) +\n  stat_summary(geom = \"point\",       \n               fun=\"mean\",         \n               colour =\"black\",     \n               size=2) + \n     geom_vline(data = cleaned_data %&gt;%\n               summarize(mean_value = mean(READ)),\n             aes(xintercept = mean_value),\n             color = \"black\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_text(data = cleaned_data %&gt;%\n               summarize(mean_score = mean(READ)),\n             aes(x = mean_score -

We can also tell from the notched boxplot that it is statistically significant that Females have higher mean and median Reading scores than males. The histograms also show that top female outliers score higher than top male outliers while bottom male outliers score lower than bottom female outliers.\n\n\nFor Schools\nThe code chunk below shows four different recommended ways to improve the boxplot’s simplicity for 10 members of a group e.g. the top 5 and bottom 5 schools based on total scores of Mathematics, Reading and Science.\n\n\ncode block\n# Create a new variable to calculate total scores of READ, MATH, and SCIENCE\ncleaned_data &lt;- cleaned_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(TOTAL_SCORE = READ + MATH + SCIENCE)\n\n# Calculate the mean total score for each school\nschool_totals &lt;- cleaned_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(SCHOOLID) %&gt;%\n  summarize(MeanTotalScore = mean(TOTAL_SCORE, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')\n\n# Select the top 5 and bottom 5 schools\ntop_bottom_schools_total &lt;- school_totals %&gt;%\n  arrange(MeanTotalScore) %&gt;%\n  slice(c(1:5, (n()-4):n())) %&gt;%\n  pull(SCHOOLID)\n\n# Filter the original dataset to include only the selected schools\nselected_school_data &lt;- cleaned_data %&gt;%\n  filter(SCHOOLID %in% top_bottom_schools_total)\n\n# Set the SCHOOLID as a factor ordered by the mean scores\nselected_school_data &lt;- selected_school_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(SCHOOLID = factor(SCHOOLID, levels = top_bottom_schools_total))\n\ncounts &lt;- selected_school_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(SCHOOLID) %&gt;%\n  summarise(count = n())\n\n\n\n\nPlot 1 with Notched Boxplots\n\n\ncode block\np1  &lt;- ggplot(selected_school_data, aes(x = READ, y = SCHOOLID)) +\n  geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE) +\n  stat_summary(geom = \"point\",       \n               fun = \"mean\",         \n               colour = \"black\",     \n               size = 2) + \n  geom_vline(data = cleaned_data %&gt;%\n               summarize(mean_score = mean(READ), median_score = median(READ)),\n             aes(xintercept = mean_score), color = \"black\", linetype = \"dashed\") +  \n  geom_text(data = cleaned_data %&gt;%\n               summarize(mean_score = mean(READ)),\n             aes(x = mean_score -

there were 10 schools that were to be represented and the other plots seem to visually represent these 10 in a messy manner. It was hard for the eye to focus and draw any conclusions. The Ridgeline plot allowed the top 5 and bottom 5 to be seamlessly separated by the mean score for Reading and packed the schools together for easy comparability. It was easy to see that the top 5 schools and bottom 5 schools had variations between the groups and the bottom 5 performing schools had variations within their groups. Better performing schools also had higher student representation on average.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Makeover\nThe code chunk below prepares the individual histogram plots for each subject.\n\nReading vs GenderReading vs SESReading vs Schools\n\n\n\n\ncode block\ngender_counts &lt;- cleaned_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(GENDER) %&gt;%\n  summarise(count = n())\n\n# Calculate mean scores by gender\ngender_means &lt;- cleaned_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(GENDER) %&gt;%\n  summarise(MeanREADScore = mean(READ, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')\n\n# Determine the order based on mean scores\ngender_order &lt;- gender_means %&gt;%\n  arrange(MeanREADScore) %&gt;%\n  pull(GENDER)\n\n\nreadvsgen &lt;-ggplot(cleaned_data, \n       aes(x = READ, \n           y = factor(GENDER, levels = gender_order),\n           color = GENDER)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA,\n               height = 0.5) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .15,\n               outlier.shape = NA,\n               notch = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"#c73824\", \"#0477bf\")) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.1, \n            binwidth = 3,\n            dotsize = 0.5,\n            alpha = 0.4,\n            aes(color = GENDER))  +\n    stat_summary(geom = \"point\",       \n               fun=\"mean\",         \n               colour =\"black\",        \n               size=2) +\n   geom_vline(data = cleaned_data %&gt;%\n               summarize(mean_value = mean(READ)),\n             aes(xintercept = mean_value),\n             color = \"black\", linetype = \"dashed\") + \n    geom_text(data = cleaned_data %&gt;%\n               summarize(mean_score = mean(READ)),\n             aes(x = mean_score -

    "text": "3.1 Visualising Distribution with Ridgeline Plot\n\nWhat did Prof Kam say?\nRidgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\nNote\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Plotting ridgeline graph: ggridges method\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Varying fill colors along the x axis\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient().

    "text": "3.2 Visualising Distribution with Raincloud Plot\n\nWhat did Prof Kam say?\nRaincloud Plot is a data visualisation techniques that produces a half-density to a distribution plot. It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\n3.2.1 Plotting a Half Eye graph\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualization, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)            \n\n\n\nWarning!\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\nWe remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Adding the boxplot with geom_boxplot()\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2. This produces a narrow boxplot. We reduce the width and adjust the opacity.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA)             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Adding the Dot Plots with stat_dots()\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using stat_dots() of ggdist package. This produces a half-dotplot, which is similar to a histogram that indicates the number of samples (number of dots) in each bin. We select side = “left” to indicate we want it on the left-hand side.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2)          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Finishing touch\nLastly, coord_flip() of ggplot2 package will be used to flip the raincloud chart horizontally to give it the raincloud appearance. At the same time, theme_economist() of ggthemes package is used to give the raincloud chart a professional publishing standard look.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 1.5) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_economist()"

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10.\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\nBayes factors have been offered by Bayesians as alternatives to P values (or significance probabilities) for testing hypotheses and for quantifying the degree to which observed data support or conflict with a hypothesis.\n\n\n\n2.2.1.2 How to interpret Bayes Factor\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number. What the Bayes factor actually measures is the change in the odds in favor of the hypothesis when going from the prior to the posterior.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Two-sample mean test: ggbetweenstats()\nIn the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for two-sample mean test of Maths scores by gender.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncode block\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = GENDER, \n  y = MATHS,\n  type = \"np\",\n  messages = FALSE\n) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Oneway ANOVA Test: ggbetweenstats() method\nIn the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for One-way ANOVA test on English score by race.\n\n“ns” → only non-significant\n“s” → only significant\n“all” → everything\n\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncode block\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = RACE, \n  y = ENGLISH,\n  type = \"p\",\n  mean.ci = TRUE, \n  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, \n  pairwise.display = \"s\",\n  p.adjust.method = \"fdr\",\n  messages = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Significant Test of Correlation: ggscatterstats()\nIn the code chunk below, ggscatterstats() is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Correlation between Maths scores and English scores.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncode block\nggscatterstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = MATHS,\n  y = ENGLISH,\n  marginal = FALSE,\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.5 Significant Test of Association (Dependence) : ggbarstats() methods\nIn the code chunk below, the Maths scores is binned into a 4-class variable by using cut().\n\n\ncode block\nexam1 &lt;- exam %&gt;% \n  mutate(MATHS_bins = \n           cut(MATHS, \n               breaks = c(0,60,75,85,100))\n)\n\n\nIn this code chunk below ggbarstats() is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Association.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncode block\nggbarstats(exam1, \n           x = MATHS_bins, \n           y = GENDER)"

    "text": "3.1 Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggplot2 methods\nA point estimate is a single number, such as a mean. Uncertainty, on the other hand, is expressed as standard error, confidence interval, or credible interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDon’t confuse the uncertainty of a point estimate with the variation in the sample.\n\n\n\nOwn Research\nAccording to Visualizing uncertainty,\nQuantities that describe the population are called parameters, and they are generally not knowable. However, we can use a sample to make a guess about the true parameter values, and statisticians refer to such guesses as estimates. The sample mean (or average) is an estimate for the population mean, which is a parameter. The estimates of individual parameter values are also called point estimates, since each can be represented by a point on a line.\nA sample will consist of a set of specific observations. The number of the individual observations in the sample is called the sample size. From the sample we can calculate a sample mean and a sample standard deviation, and these will generally differ from the population mean and standard deviation. Finally, we can define a sampling distribution, which is the distribution of estimates we would obtain if we repeated the sampling process many times. The width of the sampling distribution is called the standard error, and it tells us how precise our estimates are. In other words, the standard error provides a measure of the uncertainty associated with our parameter estimate. As a general rule, the larger the sample size, the smaller the standard error and thus the less uncertain the estimate.\nIt is critical that we don’t confuse the standard deviation and the standard error. The standard deviation is a property of the population. It tells us how much spread there is among individual observations we could make. For example, if we consider the population of voting districts, the standard deviation tells us how different different districts are from one another. By contrast, the standard error tells us how precisely we have determined a parameter estimate. If we wanted to estimate the mean voting outcome over all districts, the standard error would tells us how accurate our estimate for the mean is.\n\n\n\nKey concepts of statistical sampling. The variable of interest that we are studying has some true distribution in the population, with a true population mean and standard deviation. Any finite sample of that variable will have a sample mean and standard deviation that differ from the population parameters. If we sampled repeatedly and calculated a mean each time, then the resulting means would be distributed according to the sampling distribution of the mean. The standard error provides information about the width of the sampling distribution, which informs us about how precisely we are estimating the parameter of interest (here, the population mean).\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to plot error bars of maths scores by race by using data provided in exam tibble data frame.\nFirstly, the code chunk below will be used to derive the necessary summary statistics.\n\n\ncode block\nmy_sum &lt;- exam %&gt;%\n  group_by(RACE) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    n=n(),\n    mean=mean(MATHS),\n    sd=sd(MATHS)\n    ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(se=sd/sqrt(n-1))\n\n\n\ngroup_by() of dplyr package is used to group the observation by RACE,\nsummarise() is used to compute the count of observations, mean, standard deviation\nmutate() is used to derive standard error of Maths by RACE, and\nthe output is save as a tibble data table called my_sum.\n\n\nWhat did Prof Kam say?\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\ngroup_by() of dplyr package is used to group the observation by RACE,\nsummarise() is used to compute the count of observations, mean, standard deviation\nmutate() is used to derive standard error of Maths by RACE, and\nthe output is save as a tibble data table called my_sum.\n\n\nNext, the code chunk below will be used to display my_sum tibble data frame in an html table format.\n\n\ncode block\nknitr::kable(head(my_sum), format = 'html')\n\n\n\n\n\nRACE\nn\nmean\nsd\nse\n\n\n\n\nChinese\n193\n76.50777\n15.69040\n1.132357\n\n\nIndian\n12\n60.66667\n23.35237\n7.041005\n\n\nMalay\n108\n57.44444\n21.13478\n2.043177\n\n\nOthers\n9\n69.66667\n10.72381\n3.791438\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Plotting standard error bars of point estimates\nNow we are ready to plot the standard error bars of mean maths score by race as shown below.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(my_sum) +\n  geom_errorbar(\n    aes(x=RACE, \n        ymin=mean-se, \n        ymax=mean+se), \n    width=0.2, \n    colour=\"black\", \n    alpha=0.9, \n    size=0.5) +\n  geom_point(aes\n           (x=RACE, \n            y=mean), \n           stat=\"identity\", \n           color=\"red\",\n           size = 1.5,\n           alpha=1) +\n  ggtitle(\"Standard error of mean Maths score by Race\")     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat did Prof Kam say?\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nThe error bars are computed by using the formula mean+/-se.\nFor geom_point(), it is important to indicate stat=“identity”.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Plotting confidence interval of point estimates\nInstead of plotting the standard error bar of point estimates, we can also plot the confidence intervals of mean maths score by race.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(my_sum) +\n  geom_errorbar(\n    aes(x=reorder(RACE, -mean), \n        ymin=mean-1.96*se, \n        ymax=mean+1.96*se), \n    width=0.2, \n    colour=\"black\", \n    alpha=0.9, \n    size=0.5) +\n  geom_point(aes\n           (x=RACE, \n            y=mean), \n           stat=\"identity\", \n           color=\"red\",\n           size = 1.5,\n           alpha=1) +\n  labs(x = \"Maths score\",\n       title = \"95% confidence interval of mean Maths score by Race\")    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat did Prof Kam say?\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nThe confidence intervals are computed by using the formula mean+/-1.96*se.\nThe error bars is sorted by using the average maths scores.\nlabs() argument of ggplot2 is used to change the x-axis label.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates with interactive error bars\nIn this section, you will learn how to plot interactive error bars for the 99% confidence interval of mean maths score by race as shown in the figure below.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncode block\nshared_df = SharedData$new(my_sum)\n\nbscols(widths = c(5,7),\n       ggplotly((ggplot(shared_df) +\n                   geom_errorbar(aes(\n                     x=reorder(RACE, -mean),\n                     ymin=mean-2.58*se, \n                     ymax=mean+2.58*se), \n                     width=0.2, \n                     colour=\"black\", \n                     alpha=0.9, \n                     size=0.5) +\n                   geom_point(aes(\n                     x=RACE, \n                     y=mean, \n                     text = paste(\"Race:\", `RACE`, \n                                  \"&lt;br&gt;N:\", `n`,\n                                  \"&lt;br&gt;Avg.
