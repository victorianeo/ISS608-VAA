It was interesting to see different examples of the layers but after awhile it got a little tedious. I did have a lot of time to play around with Quarto and RStudio so that I could quickly familiarise myself.\nI do hope to see more of how we can structure our thinking of data analytics according to a Layered Grammar of Graphics (Am loving this!). I am looking forward to this course!"

Their positions are also clear but I would prefer the ggtitle to be centered, rather than at the side so I added one extra line of code).\nWhile binning on 10 with ggplot2 is the same number of bins as R Graphics, ggplot2 gives us quartiles - Quartiles are useful for the measure of central tendency and spread for highly skewed data, which is the case for MATHS.\nThe background of ggplot2 have grid lines which makes it easier for the eye to follow the values.\n\n\n\nApparently, this is due to the notion of visual variables (that was introduced by Jacques Bertin in 1967) and the associated levels of perception affect the effectiveness of data visualisation.\n\nThe transferable skills from ggplot2 are not the idiosyncrasies of plotting syntax, but a powerful way of thinking about visualisation, as a way of mapping between variables and the visual properties of geometric objects that you can perceive. ~Hadley Wickham\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAm loving this!\n\n\n\nInterestingly, how we visualise this data should reflect how we make sense of the world. The following quote also stood out for me as it reinforces the notion that data visualisation is not isolated from data analysis - “Data analysis without data visualisation is no data analysis” (Cleveland, 1994 in Kam, 2023).\n\nggplot2 is designed to work iteratively. You start with a layer that shows the raw data. Then you add layers of annotations and statistical summaries. This allows you to produce graphics using the same structured thinking that you would use to design an analysis. This reduces the distance between the plot in your head and the one on the page. This is especially helpful for students who have not yet developed the structured approach to analysis used by experts. ~Hadley Wickham (bold my own)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 A Layered Grammar of Graphics\n\n\n\nReference: Hadley Wickham (2010) “A layered grammar of graphics.” Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 3–28.\n\n\n\nData: The dataset being plotted.\nAesthetics take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.\nFacets split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics, statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate systems define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.\nThemes modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background.\n\n\n\n2.3 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: data\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nA blank canvas appears.\nggplot() initializes a ggplot object.\nThe data argument defines the dataset to be used for plotting.\nIf the dataset is not already a data.frame, it will be converted to one by fortify().\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: Aesthetic mappings\nAesthetic mappings take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics such as position, colour, size, shape, or transparency (also part of Bertin’s and other researchers’ set of “retinal” variables). Each visual characteristic can thus encode an aspect of the data and be used to convey information.\nAll aesthetics of a plot are specified in the aes() function call (each geom layer can have its own aes specification).\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nggplot includes the x-axis and the axis’s label.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: geom\nGeometric objects are the actual marks we put on a plot. Examples include:\n\ngeom_point for drawing individual points (e.g., a scatter plot)\ngeom_line for drawing lines (e.g., for a line charts)\ngeom_smooth for drawing smoothed lines (e.g., for simple trends or approximations)\ngeom_bar for drawing bars (e.g., for bar charts)\ngeom_histogram for drawing binned values (e.g. a histogram)\ngeom_polygon for drawing arbitrary shapes\ngeom_map for drawing polygons in the shape of a map! (You can access the data to use for these maps by using the map_data() function).\n\n\n\nA plot must have at least one geom; there is no upper limit. You can add a geom to a plot using the + operator.\nFor complete list, please refer to here.\n\n\n2.5.1 Geometric Objects: geom_bar\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Geometric Objects: geom_dotplot\nIn a dot plot, the width of a dot corresponds to the bin width (or maximum width, depending on the binning algorithm), and dots are stacked, with each dot representing one observation.\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.5)\n\n\nBin width defaults to 1/30 of the range of the data. Pick better value with\n`binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe y scale is not very useful, in fact it is very misleading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n?Question? 1\n\n\n\nI wonder why the y scale is suddenly in decimal place (0.00, 0.25 etc) when it was previously in count.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below performs the following two steps:\n\nscale_y_continuous() is used to turn off the y-axis, and\nbinwidth argument is used to change the binwidth to 2.5.\n\n\n\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(binwidth=2.5,         \n               dotsize = 0.5) +      \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,           \n                     breaks = NULL) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n?Question? 2\n\n\n\n\nI wonder why the binwidth is changed to 2.5. It looks the same as the previous binning.\n\n\n\n\nWith binwidth = 2\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(binwidth=2,         \n               dotsize = 0.5) +      \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,           \n                     breaks = NULL) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith binwidth = 3.5\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(binwidth=3.5,         \n               dotsize = 0.5) +      \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,           \n                     breaks = NULL) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nbinwidth “controls the width of each bin along the X-axis” (R Coder, 2024). While it might be similar between binwidth = 2.5 and 3, it is more proportionate than when binwidth =2 and 3.5 and therefore pleasing to the eye. Thus, changing to 2.5 is just to address the error code.\n\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Geometric Objects: geom_histogram()\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram() \n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that the default bin is 30.\n\n\n\n\n2.5.4 Modifying a geometric object by changing geom()\nIn the code chunk below,\n\nbins argument is used to change the number of bins to 20,\nfill argument is used to shade the histogram with light blue color, and\ncolor argument is used to change the outline colour of the bars in black\n\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20,            \n                 color=\"black\",      \n                 fill=\"light blue\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.5 Modifying a geometric object by changing aes()\nThe code chunk below changes the interior colour of the histogram (i.e. fill) by using sub-group of aesthetic().\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           fill = GENDER)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"grey30\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis approach can be used to colour, fill and alpha of the geometric.\n\n\n\n\n2.5.6 Geometric Objects: geom-density()\ngeom-density() computes and plots kernel density estimate, which is a smoothed version of the histogram.\nIt is a useful alternative to the histogram for continuous data that comes from an underlying smooth distribution.\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots two kernel density lines by using colour or fill arguments of aes()\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS, \n           colour = GENDER)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.7 Geometric Objects: geom_boxplot\ngeom_boxplot() displays continuous value list. It visualises five summary statistics (the median, two hinges and two whiskers), and all “outlying” points individually.\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS,       \n           x= GENDER)) +    \n  geom_boxplot()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotches are used in box plots to help visually assess whether the medians of distributions differ. If the notches do not overlap, this is evidence that the medians are different.\nThe code chunk below plots the distribution of Maths scores by gender in notched plot instead of boxplot.\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.8 Geometric Objects: geom_violin\ngeom_violin is designed for creating violin plot. Violin plots are a way of comparing multiple data distributions. With ordinary density curves, it is difficult to compare more than just a few distributions because the lines visually interfere with each other. With a violin plot, it’s easier to compare several distributions since they’re placed side by side.\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_violin() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.9 Geometric Objects: geom_point()\ngeom_point() is especially useful for creating scatterplot.\nThe code chunk below plots a scatterplot showing the Maths and English grades of pupils by using geom_point().\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.10 geom objects can be combined\nThe code chunk below plots the data points on the boxplots by using both geom_boxplot() and geom_point().\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +                    \n  geom_point(position=\"jitter\", \n             size = 0.5) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: stat\nThe Statistics functions statistically transform data, usually as some form of summary.

They are an alternative to aesthetics for displaying additional discrete variables. ggplot2 supports two types of factes, namely: facet_grid() and facet_wrap.\n\n2.7.1 Working with facet_wrap()\nfacet_wrap wraps a 1d sequence of panels into 2d. This is generally a better use of screen space than facet_grid because most displays are roughly rectangular.\nThe code chunk below plots a trellis plot using facet-wrap().\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20) +\n    facet_wrap(~ CLASS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7.2 facet_grid()function\nfacet_grid() forms a matrix of panels defined by row and column facetting variables. It is most useful when you have two discrete variables, and all combinations of the variables exist in the data.\nThe code chunk below plots a trellis plot using facet_grid().\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20) +\n    facet_wrap(~ CLASS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.8 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: Coordinates\nThe Coordinates functions map the position of objects onto the plane of the plot. There are a number of different possible coordinate systems to use, they are:\n-   [`coord_cartesian()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_cartesian.html): the default cartesian coordinate systems, where you specify x and y values (e.g. allows you to zoom in or out). \n-   [`coord_flip()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_flip.html): a cartesian system with the x and y flipped. \n-   [`coord_fixed()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_fixed.html): a cartesian system with a \"fixed\" aspect ratio (e.g. 1.78 for a \"widescreen\" plot). \n-   [`coord_quickmap()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_map.html): a coordinate system that approximates a good aspect ratio for maps.\n\n2.8.1 Working with Coordinate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBy the default, the bar chart of ggplot2 is in vertical form.\n\n\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below flips the horizontal bar chart into vertical bar chart by using coord_flip().\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.8.2 Changing the y- and x-axis range\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot below is slightly misleading because the y-axis and x-axis range are not equal.\n\n\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, size=0.5)\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below fixed both the y-axis and x-axis range from 0-100.\n\n\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.9 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: themes\nThemes control elements of the graph not related to the data. For example:\n\nbackground colour\nsize of fonts\ngridlines\ncolour of labels\n\nBuilt-in themes include: - theme_gray() (default) - theme_bw() - theme_classic()\nA list of theme can be found at this link. Each theme element can be conceived of as either a line (e.g. x-axis), a rectangle (e.g. graph background), or text (e.g. axis title).\n\n2.9.1 Working with theme\nThe code chunk below plot a horizontal bar chart using theme_gray().\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_gray()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA horizontal bar chart plotted using theme_classic().\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA horizontal bar chart plotted using theme_minimal().\n\n\ncode block\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal()"

In this section, I am going to shared with you an ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily.

    "text": "1.2 The Literature Review\n\nEquity in education means that personal or social circumstances such as gender, socio-economic status, migrant background, age, special needs, or place of residence, do not hinder the achievement of one’s educational potential (fairness) ~OECD Education GPS (2023)\n\nIn Singapore, due to our meritocratic system, education and schools are seen as the great equaliser (although talk about equality of opportunities has shifted towards equity of opportunities) to ensure that every child has the same opportunity to academically excel. At the same time, demographic indicators such as Gender and SES also affect academic performance.\n\n1.2.1 Schools and academic performance1.2.2 SES and academic performance1.2.3 Gender and academic performance\n\n\nMinister for Education Chan Chun Sing, in a 2023 MOE speech, stated that:\n\nOECD’s PISA study found that our students from less advantaged backgrounds not only outperformed their international counterparts of similar socio-economic backgrounds, but they did better than the OECD average in all core domains.\n\nThese students typically have less access to private tuition, and have still managed to do well by international standards.\nThis goes to show that our students are industrious, and our education system is doing something right.\nInstead of attributing our students’ achievements to the private tuition industry, I think we should give credit to our students, schools, and teachers where credit is due.\n\n\nPISA (2022) reported that:\n\nIn Singapore, compared to attending a public school, the difference in mathematics performance associated with attendance at private schools is among the smallest of the OECD and partner countries/economies, after accounting for students’ and schools’ socio-economic profile.\n\nThis suggests that schools play an equalising role in academic performance, especially for Math (according to PISA). However, there is still an unofficial differentiation of schools into Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3, despite MOE removing school rankings. As argued by the article “Is Every School a Good School? Intergenerational Mobility in Singapore, Explained”(The Kopi, 2022), “differences in funding, programmes and networks means that some schools might provide more opportunities for [their own] students than others”.\n\n\nThe imbalance in resources due to the difference in socioeconomic status affects a child’s education journey as according to the article “Commentary: How can Singapore lessen the impact of SES on educational achievements?” (ChannelNewsAsia, 29 Sept 2022),”parents with the financial means can provide resources such as tuition to enhance their children’s learning, and better provide them with a head-start in life.”\nThis was supported by PISA (2022):\n\nSingapore has one of the highest differences in mathematics performance between students in the top quarter and students in the bottom quarter of the economic, social and cultural status index (ESCS).\n\nThe difference in mathematics performance associated with a one-unit increase in the PISA index of economic, social and cultural status (ESCS) is one of the largest among PISA-participating countries and economies.\nThe difference in science performance associated with a one-unit increase in the PISA index of economic, social and cultural status (ESCS) is one of the largest among PISA-participating countries and economies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand To Learn More About The Effect of SES on academic performance\n\n\n\n\n\n“Parents with the financial means can provide resources such as tuition to enhance their children’s learning, and better provide them with a head-start in life. Conversely, parents from the lower-income brackets tend to lack the resources to augment their children’s learning.\nWithout adequate guidance at home, children from less financially stable families are often ill-prepared for learning. As a result, pupils from more humble backgrounds are identified as weaker students as early as Primary 1.\nAdditionally, these students often do not have role models who can advise them on the pathways to educational success. This often affects their ability to make sound decisions, due to a lack of awareness of the implications that their choices may have on their future.\nThese early academic gaps widen when students from higher-income families continue to outperform and move on to schools that have more access to resources.\nFor instance, independent schools that cater to higher-achieving students will have resources that expose them to enrichment programmes and out-of-classroom learning activities.\nWhen students from humbler families lag their higher SES classmates in academic performance, this can have larger implications on social mobility as well, as national exams determine the type of education these children will go on to receive, the future friends and connections they make, and their eventual jobs.”\n\n\n\n\n\nGender inequality seems to have changed in favour of girls over time - Statistics Singapore (2022) reported that “with more rapid improvement in educational attainment among females, the difference in mean years of schooling” has narrowed, with it becoming smaller for the younger age groups.\n\n\n\nTaken from Statistics Singapore (2022)\n\n\nPISA (2022) also found that:\n\nBoys outperformed girls in mathematics by 12 score points; girls outperformed boys in reading by 20 score points in Singapore.\n\nThe difference between girls and boys in science performance is one of the largest among PISA-participating countries and economies in favour of girls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand To Learn More About The Effect of Gender on academic performance\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was reported in a 2017 article “Girls lead in primary school but boys catch up: MOE study“ (The Straits Times, 22 Jan 2017:\n“Girls tend to outdo boys academically at a younger age although this gap closes as they enter their late teens and early 20s.\nStatistics from the Ministry of Education (MOE) showed that in the last 10 years, girls performed “slightly better” than boys in the Primary School Leaving Examination. Girls were around 2 to 3 percentage points over-represented in the top quintile, and about 3 to 4 percentage points under-represented in the bottom quintile.\nAt the O levels, girls were around 1 to 2 percentage points over-represented in the top quintile and about 1 to 2 percentage points under-represented in the bottom quintile.\nBut there was hardly any distinction in qualification to the tertiary level. The numbers of males and females pursuing degrees in local universities have been comparable over the past three years, said the ministry.\nFor instance, out of a total of 18,126 undergraduates in the 2015 intake for the six publicly-funded universities, 9,192 were female.”"
